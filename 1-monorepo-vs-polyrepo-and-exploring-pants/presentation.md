## An Overview of Build Tools
<img src="assets/modern-software-development-meme.webp" width="500" class="fragment start">

Build tools have a common core, **modeling dependencies**:  <!-- .element class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->

<img src="assets/build-dependency-network.webp">

------
### Continued: An Overview of Build Tools
Build tool types:
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Task-oriented
  - Explain the dependency network using a set of tasks
  - Examples: Ant, NAnt, MSBuild
  - Don't retain state between builds, making it unsuitable for C++ compilation
  - Work well with languages like C# because their compilers have built-in logic for incremental builds.
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Product-oriented
  - Explain things based on the products they generate
  - Examples: Make (also supports _phony targets_ like install), Bazel, Pants, and Buck (these three are almost mixed)
  - Maintain their state using timestamps on the generated files from each task.
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Mixed
  - Such as Rake

<details>
<summary>Note</summary>
Mention the _cookie targets_ in Make.
</details>

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Make
A strong, **product-oriented** build tool that tracks dependencies and **only builds affected components**.

&shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->But, **it's hard to debug** complex Makefiles. In larger codebases, teams often create a Makefile for each directory and use a top-level Makefile to run them **recursively**, a practice that's [considered problematic](https://accu.org/journals/overload/14/71/miller_2004/):
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/makefile-example.webp" width="600"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/recursive-makefile.webp" width="250"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some other drawbacks:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- OS specific (it depends on the shell)
- Whitespace can be important in some cases
- Doesn't support extensions

<img src="assets/makefile-syntax-meme.webp" class="fragment end" width="800">

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Ant
Ant's core is in Java, while its scripts are an **external DSL in XML**. This mix provides Ant with robust **cross-platform** capabilities:

<img src="assets/ant-example.webp" width="750">

Some shortcomings:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- &shy;<!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->**XML** is **not concise** or **enjoyable** for humans to read.
- &shy;<!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->There are **no real domain concepts** beyond tasks.
- &shy;<!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->You can't easily respond to questions like **"How many tests ran?"** or **"How long did they take?"**.
- &shy;<!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->Import and macrodef tasks support reuse but may be **confusing for novices**.

&shy;<!-- .element class="fragment fade-in" -->Ant files can become very long and disorganized due to these limitations, sometimes extending to **thousands of lines**.

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: NAnt and MSBuild
**NAnt** and **Ant** have a **similar syntax**, with only a few differences. **Microsoft** later introduced a variant called **MSBuild**, tightly **integrated into Visual Studio**, specializing in building **solutions**, handling dependencies, and managing projects:

<img src="assets/msbuild-example.webp">

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Maven
<img src="assets/maven-meme.webp" width="500" class="fragment start">

&shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->Maven simplifies Ant files by **assuming certain Java project layouts**. By favoring **"convention over configuration"**, it can handle various tasks like **build**, **deploy**, **test**, and **release** with just **one command**, often needing minimal XML configuration:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/pom-example.webp" width="570"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/maven-project-structure.webp" width="320"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some shortcomings:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- &shy;<!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->Projects **not following Maven's assumptions** can make achieving desired results **tricky**, **seen as a feature** by some.
- &shy;<!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->To extend it, **coding is necessary**, but it **offers plugins** for nearly every desired functionality.

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Rake
Rake, the **main Ruby build tool**, started as an experiment to **mimic Make** using an **internal Ruby DSL**. It handles **tasks** and **dependencies**. Since the scripts are standard Ruby code, you can use it's versatility as a **general-purpose programming language**:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/rake-example.webp" width="700"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/rake-dependency-example.webp" width="700"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

&shy;<!-- .element class="fragment fade-in" -->You can **refactor** and **modularize** builds in your regular development environment. Debugging is easy with the **standard Ruby debugger**.

Some disadvantages:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- You need to ensure a suitable runtime is available on your platform
- You have to interact with RubyGems

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Buildr, Gradle
New-gen build tools like Buildr, Gradle, and Gantt use **real programming languages** for build scripts.

&shy;<!-- .element class="fragment fade-in" -->Buildr is **based on Rake**, so anything you can do in Rake, you can do in Buildr. Moreover, Buildr seamlessly **replaces Maven**, sharing the **same conventions like filesystem layout**, **artifact specs**, and **repositories**. You can also **use Ant tasks**, with no setup needed.

&shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->Gradle was designed for **multi-project builds**, often **large in scale**. It relies on a series of build **tasks** that can run **serially** or in **parallel**. It also supports incremental builds:

<img src="assets/gradle-example.webp" style="border: 1px solid lightgray" width="550">

&shy;<!-- .element class="fragment fade-in" -->If you're starting **a new Java project** or seeking an **alternative to Ant or Maven**, consider **Gradle** or Buildr with **DSLs in Groovy**.

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Psake
Psake is an **internal DSL** written in **PowerShell**, which provides **task-oriented** dependency networks:

<img src="assets/psake-example.webp">

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Bazel (Google), Buck (Facebook), Pants (Twitter)
Three of the most popular **Monorepo tools** and **declarative build systems**.

Common concepts are:
- **Goals and Commands:** build, test, lint, check, fmt, export, run, audit, clean, coverage, ...
- **Rules, Targets:** cc_library, python_source, java_source, docker_image, java_library, protobuf_source, ...
- **BUILD files**

```console
$ ./pants test ::
```

```console
$ ./pants test example:tests@interpreter_constraints=py2
```

```BUILD
# BUILD file

python_test(
  name="tests",
  source="tests.py",
  interpreter_constraints=parametrize(py2=["==2.7.*"], py3=[">=3.6"]),
)
```

&shy;<!-- .element class="fragment fade-in" -->They support **multiple programming languages**, **incremental builds**, **heavy and distributed caching**, **parallelization**, **code generation**, **dependency management and visualization**.

## Monorepo (Reference: <a href="https://monorepo.tools/">monorepo.tools</a>)
A monorepo is a **single repository** containing **multiple distinct projects**, with **well-defined relationships**:

<img src="assets/monorepo-polyrepo.svg" width="550">

------
### Monorepo != Monolith
A good monorepo is the opposite of monolithic:

<img src="assets/monorepo-vs-monolith.png">

------
### Polyrepo
A polyrepo is the current standard way of developing applications: **one repo per team, app, or project**. Typically, each repo has a **single build artifact** and a **simple build pipeline**.

<img src="assets/polyrepo-practice.svg" width="650">

The industry has moved to the polyrepo way of doing things for one big reason: **team autonomy**.

------
### Repository Management and Software Structure Organization Spectrums

<img src="assets/structure-and-repository-specturms.svg">

------
### Polyrepo Drawbacks
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Cumbersome code sharing
  - To share code across repos, you'd likely create a repo for shared code (CI, tools, dependencies, versioning, etc.).
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Significant code duplication
  - Teams avoid the trouble of setting up a shared repo, creating their own versions of common services and components in each repo.
- Costly cross-repo changes to shared libraries and consumers  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Inconsistent tooling
  - Each project uses its own set of commands for running tests, building, serving, linting, deploying, and so forth.

------
### Monorepo Benefits
- No overhead to create new projects  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- Atomic commits across projects  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- One version of everything  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Developer mobility
  - Developers can confidently contribute to other teams' applications and verify that their changes are safe.

&shy;<!-- .element class="fragment fade-in" -->It is **more than code & tools**. It changes your **organization** and the **way you think about code**. By adding **consistency**, **lowering the friction in creating new projects** and performing **large scale refactorings**, by facilitating **code sharing** and **cross-team collaboration**, it enhances your organization's **efficiency**.

------
### Monorepo Tools
As your **workspace grows**, the tools have to help you keep it **fast**, **understandable** and **manageable**:

### Monorepo Drawbacks
- Weak Multiple Languages Support  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - The ideal monorepo tool for one programming language may not be suitable for others.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - But, most monorepo tools support internal and external plugins.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Git submodules can be an option for managing multiple languages in a monorepo.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- VCS Tooling Challenges  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - The complexity and size of the codebase, which makes it difficult to understand, search, scale, and maintain.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Microsoft has released a Virtual File System (VFS) for Git to help manage the overload.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- CI Tooling Challenges  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Azure, Circle, and Jenkins, popular CI solutions, offer flexibility, but it may take time to accomplish some tasks.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Limitations Around Access Control  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Your company may not want every engineer to have access to the entire codebase.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - GitHub and GitLab support CODEOWNERS file to define which team owns subdirectories in the repository.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Heavy Build Pipelines  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Many CI tools offer conditional stages based on directory changes, like SemaphoreCI's "change_in" and Jenkins' "changeset."  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
